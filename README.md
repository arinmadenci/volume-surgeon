# Case Volume and Mortality: The Effect of Intervening on Physicians

## Abstract
<strong>Background:</strong> Researchers and policymakers seeking to optimize healthcare delivery often considerwhether medical services should be regionalized to expert providers or specialized centers. On theone hand, these services would become less readily available to the patients who need them; on theother hand, clinicians may become more familiar and adept with the repetition of frequently treatingthe same conditions. Research studies have previously identified a correlation between the number ofcertain operations that surgeons perform and their patients’ outcomes; the number of radiographsinterpreted by radiologists and their diagnostic performance; and the frequency with which a hospital treats patients with certain conditions and their patients’ outcomes. However, previous analyses haveoften been cross-sectional and have not considered time-varying confounding or common positivityviolations.

<strong>Methods:</strong> We consider an application of this type of research in order to demonstrate commonprinciples and a methodology that may be adapted to numerous other scenarios of substantive interest. Using the example of surgeons who perform coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) operationsfor United States Medicare beneficiaries, we make explicit assumptions to evaluate the effect ofintervening in different ways on the operative volume of surgeons.

<strong>Results:</strong> We first describe four hypothetical randomized trials of interest and then demonstrate howto emulate these trials among surgeons who have performed CABG operations for United StatesMedicare beneficiaries.  We draw attention to areas of bias in previously published observationalanalyses that occur due to deviations from the hypothetical randomized trial of interest. In each targettrial emulation, we report that interventions on physician volume of CABG operations were ultimatelyfound to have little effect on patient mortality, except potentially in cases of extreme restructuring ofreferral patterns.

<strong>Conclusions:</strong> When the substantive interest lies in intervening on physicians’ patient volumes, thismanuscript demonstrates how the target trial framework can be used to estimate the resulting effecton the resulting outcomes. This overall methodological approach can be modified for application toother operations and research questions in areas of healthcare outside of surgery.
